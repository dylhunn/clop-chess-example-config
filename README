This repo contains my files to get CLOP running on my chess engine, to optimize its evaluation function.

It was a bit tricky. I made several changes to the cutechess source to make it compile with the latest linux g++, and to make it print the game results.

To use:

./clop-console c <experiment.clop

Change engines.json and experiment.clop as you wish, and modify cutechess-clop.py with your parameters and engine name.

Be sure to `chmod 777 *` to execute everything.

This works on my Fedora 25, but no promises.
